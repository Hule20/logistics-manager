# Logistics Manager

This is my finals project for a Java course on my college

## Description:

This application is intended for transportation companies to track their resources - drivers and vehicles, as well as to track the routes that need to be taken

## Main features you could reuse in your project:

<ul>
  <li>[Project OSRM API](http://project-osrm.org/docs/v5.5.1/api/#general-options) integration</li>
  <li>[Gluon Maps](https://github.com/gluonhq/maps) implementation</li>
  <li>UI built using JavaFX</li>
</ul>
