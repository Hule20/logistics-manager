# Logistics Manager

This is my finals project for a Java course on my college

## Description:

This application is intended for transportation companies to track their resources - drivers and vehicles, as well as to track the routes that need to be taken

## Main features you could reuse in your project:

- [Project OSRM API](http://project-osrm.org/docs/v5.5.1/api/#general-options) integration
- [Gluon Maps](https://github.com/gluonhq/maps) implementation
- UI built using JavaFX
- MVC build pattern with CRUD operations on entities
